 User story

 - We need to improve our dashboards. We do not want to use 3rd party graph packages on our site though as they slow down the site design.
We have need for a javascript generated graph that will display a percentage as a graphic with animation.
The graphic should consist of a donut graph with the percentage in the middle.

The graph should draw the circle with javascript animation clockwise. The percentage should fade in after the circle animation. This should not take more the 3 seconds.
Your script should be in a script file and parameter should be passed through to the script to draw the graph.
