# Project List


Within this repository I have included all my javascript projects including my Freecodecamp projects.

Here is the list of all the web tech related featured in these projects within this folder
  - Pure JavaScript, HTML 5 and CSS3
  - JQuery, Ajax
  - NodeJS
  
## Important note
```
Most of the projects depend on the CDN(Content delivery network) to work properly.
If anything breaks please check the link and the version of the CDN before yelling üòù`

Please note that all these projects are constantly under development , I always try some cool
tricks in this yard , the weather is always Beta
You can also:
  - Use your version of CDN or break it however you like 
  - Comment on any bad coding practice you find here

```
